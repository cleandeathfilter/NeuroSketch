# 🚀 START HERE - Test the New Drag System!

**Implementation Complete:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### **1. Open the App**
```
http://localhost:8000/explore.html
```

### **2. Wait for Brain to Load**
You'll see: "Loading Brain Model..." → Brain appears with white cube underneath

### **3. Test Hover (5 seconds)**
- Move mouse over white cube
- **✅ SUCCESS:** Cube turns **CYAN** + grab cursor
- Move mouse away
- **✅ SUCCESS:** Cube turns **WHITE** + default cursor

### **4. Test Drag (10 seconds)**
- Click and drag the cyan cube
- **✅ SUCCESS:** Cube turns **GREEN** + grabbing cursor
- Brain moves smoothly in XY plane
- Release mouse
- **✅ SUCCESS:** Cube turns white

### **5. Check Console (F12)**
```
🖱️ DRAG HANDLE CLICKED! {distance: "X.XXX", point: Vector3}
📍 Drag started - Z locked at: 0.000
🖱️ Drag released at position: {
    x: "X.XXX",
    y: "Y.XXX",
    z: "0.000",
    zLocked: "0.000",
    zDrift: "0.000000"  ← SHOULD BE 0!
}
```

## 🎯 What You Should See

### **Visual States:**
1. **🤍 DEFAULT** - White cube, default cursor
2. **💙 HOVER** - Cyan cube, grab cursor (when mouse over cube)
3. **💚 DRAGGING** - Green cube, grabbing cursor (while dragging)

### **Movement:**
- **Drag cube** → Brain moves in XY plane (left/right/up/down)
- **Drag brain** → Brain rotates (OrbitControls)
- **Scroll wheel** → Zoom in/out
- **Two independent systems!**

## ❌ If Something's Wrong

**Cube doesn't change color?**
- Check console for errors
- Run `debugDrag()` to see system state

**Brain moves in Z-axis?**
- Check console - zDrift should be 0.000000
- Report the exact value shown

**Can't click the cube?**
- Make sure you're clicking the white cube UNDER the brain
- Try clicking different parts of it

**Brain rotates when dragging cube?**
- This shouldn't happen - event isolation should prevent it
- Run `debugDrag()` and report the output
