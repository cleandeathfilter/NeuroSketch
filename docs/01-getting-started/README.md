# NeuroSketch - 2D Neuroscience Visualization Tool

> **Note:** This project was developed with AI assistance and is currently in active development. It is not production-ready.

**Canvas-based diagramming software for creating neuroscience visualizations and educational content.**

**Current Version:** Phase 1-8 Complete
**Last Updated:** October 5, 2025

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Automated Setup (Recommended):**
```bash
./start-server.sh    # macOS/Linux
start-server.bat     # Windows
```

**Manual Setup:**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

**Why a web server?** NeuroSketch uses ES6 modules that require `http://` protocol (browsers block `file://` due to CORS). The automated scripts handle this automatically.

**Code:** ~6,800 lines across 14 modules | **Docs:** 1,064+ lines

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Module errors:** Use a web server (not `file://`). Run automated scripts.

**Canvas not responding:** Check browser console (`F12`), hard refresh (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`), verify server running.

**Performance issues:** Keep under 100 objects for optimal 60 FPS.

**Port 8000 in use:** Automated script tries multiple ports, or use `python3 -m http.server 3000`.

## 🆘 Getting Help

**If you encounter issues:**

1. **Check this README** - Most common issues are documented above
2. **Read QUICK_START.md** - 60-second guide to getting up and running
3. **Check browser console** - Press `F12` and look for error messages (red text)
4. **Verify server is running** - Look for "Serving HTTP on..." in terminal
5. **Try automated scripts** - `start-server.sh` or `start-server.bat` handle most issues
6. **Review implemented.md** - Complete feature documentation and known issues
7. **Check BUG_FIXES_OCT2025.md** - Technical documentation of all recent fixes

**Debug Checklist:**
- [ ] Are you using a web server (not opening `index.html` directly)?
- [ ] Are all `.js` files in the same directory as `index.html`?
- [ ] Is your browser up to date (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge)?
- [ ] Have you tried hard refresh (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R`)?
- [ ] Are there errors in the browser console (`F12`)?
