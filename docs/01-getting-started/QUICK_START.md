# ðŸš€ NeuroSketch - Quick Start for New Sessions

Copy and paste this prompt to start a new session with Claude:

---

**I'm continuing development on NeuroSketch, a neuroscience visualization tool. Load `AGENTS.md` for project context and development guidelines. Check `docs/07-reference/implemented.md` for complete feature history. Review `SESSION_COMPLETE_OCT17.md` for the last session summary. What should we work on next?**

## What This Does

This 3-line prompt gives Claude everything needed:
1. **Project context** - What NeuroSketch is
2. **Development guidelines** - AGENTS.md has all patterns, architecture, and protocols
3. **Implementation history** - Complete list of what's been built
4. **Last session** - Most recent work and current state
5. **Open question** - Invites planning next steps

## Alternative Prompt (More Detailed)

**I'm working on NeuroSketch. Load `AGENTS.md` (dev guidelines), `docs/07-reference/implemented.md` (feature history), and `SESSION_COMPLETE_OCT17.md` (last session: 3D drag system complete, docs organized). Current state: Gateway navigation working, 2D canvas editor (7 tools), 3D brain viewer with drag-and-drop. Ready to continue - what's next?**

## Files to Reference

- `AGENTS.md` - Complete development protocols
- `docs/07-reference/implemented.md` - All implemented features
- `docs/07-reference/neurosketchPRP.md` - Product requirements
- `SESSION_COMPLETE_OCT17.md` - Latest session summary
- `docs/README.md` - Documentation index

## Current Project State (Oct 17, 2025)

âœ… **Working:**
- Gateway navigation (CREATE/EXPLORE modes)
- 2D Canvas Editor (7 core drawing tools)
- 3D Brain Viewer with professional drag system
- Tab cycling + Ctrl+Click precision selection
- Dark mode system
- Save/Load/Export

ðŸ”„ **In Progress:**
- Rebuilding advanced tools (neuronal components, synapses)

ðŸ“‹ **Next Up:**
- Add more 3D objects (neurons, anatomy parts)
- Implement innervation mapping
- Build knowledge graph system
