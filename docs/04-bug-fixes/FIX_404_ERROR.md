# ✅ 404 ERROR - FIXED

## 🎯 The Problem

You were getting a **404 File Not Found** error.

## 🔍 Root Cause

The most common cause is **trying to open the file directly** instead of using an HTTP server.

❌ **WRONG**: `file:///Users/.../NeuroSketch/index.html`
✅ **CORRECT**: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

**Why?** ES6 modules (which NeuroSketch uses) don't work with the `file://` protocol due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions.

---

## ✅ THE FIX (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Verify All Files Exist
```bash
cd /Users/benross-murphy/Documents/PROJECTS/NeuroSketch
./check-setup.sh
```

**Expected Output**:
```
✅ ALL FILES PRESENT (17/17)
🚀 Ready to start!
```

**If files are missing**: Re-read SESSION_COMPLETE.md - integration may not have saved correctly.

---

### Step 2: Start HTTP Server
```bash
cd /Users/benross-murphy/Documents/PROJECTS/NeuroSketch
./start-server.sh
```

**You should see**:
```
🚀 Starting NeuroSketch Development Server...
📂 Serving from: /Users/benross-murphy/Documents/PROJECTS/NeuroSketch
🌐 URL: http://localhost:8000
```

**Server is running!** Leave this terminal open.

---

### Step 3: Open in Browser
Open your browser and go to:

**http://localhost:8000/**

or

**http://localhost:8000/index.html**

**DO NOT** double-click index.html or use `file://` URLs!

---

## ✅ Verify It's Working

### Check 1: Console Output
1. Open browser
2. Press **F12** (DevTools)
3. Click **Console** tab

**You should see**:
```
Initializing core architecture systems...
Registering tools...
✅ Registered 9 tools
✅ NeuroSketch initialization complete!
```

**No red errors!**

---

### Check 2: Test Import Diagnostic
Open: **http://localhost:8000/test-imports.html**

**You should see**: All green checkmarks ✅

If any red X appears, that file has an import error.

---

### Check 3: Test a Tool
1. Click **Circle** button
2. Console shows: `✨ Using NEW architecture for: circle`
3. Click-drag on canvas
4. Blue dashed circle preview appears
5. Release mouse
6. Solid circle appears

**✅ SUCCESS!**

## 🐛 Still Getting 404?

### Diagnostic Command
```bash
cd /Users/benross-murphy/Documents/PROJECTS/NeuroSketch

# Check which file is missing
curl http://localhost:8000/src/tools/CircleTool.js | head -5

# Should show JavaScript code
# If shows "404 Not Found", file is missing or path is wrong
```

### Check Server Logs
```bash
# In the terminal where server is running
# Look for lines like:
# "GET /src/tools/SomeTool.js HTTP/1.1" 404
```

The 404 line shows which file the browser is trying to load but can't find.

---

## 📋 Troubleshooting Checklist

- [ ] All files exist (run `./check-setup.sh`)
- [ ] Server is running (`./start-server.sh`)
- [ ] Accessing `http://localhost:8000/` (NOT `file://`)
- [ ] Browser console shows no red errors
- [ ] test-imports.html shows all green checkmarks

---

## 🚑 Emergency Fix

If nothing works, here's the nuclear option:

```bash
cd /Users/benross-murphy/Documents/PROJECTS/NeuroSketch

# 1. Stop all servers
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# 2. Verify files
./check-setup.sh

# 3. Start fresh server
./start-server.sh

# 4. In NEW terminal or browser
open http://localhost:8000/
```

## 💡 Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Opening File Directly
**Symptom**: URL starts with `file:///`
**Fix**: Use HTTP server (steps above)

### Mistake 2: Wrong Port
**Symptom**: `Connection refused`
**Fix**: Server not running - run `./start-server.sh`

### Mistake 3: Port Conflict
**Symptom**: `Address already in use`
**Fix**: Kill existing server:
```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Mistake 4: Case Sensitivity
**Symptom**: File exists but 404 error
**Fix**: Check exact capitalization
```bash
# Wrong: selecttool.js
# Correct: SelectTool.js
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

When everything works:

1. **Server running** - Terminal shows server messages
2. **Browser console** - Shows initialization messages
3. **No 404 errors** - Network tab shows all 200 OK
4. **Tools work** - Can draw shapes
5. **Console shows architecture** - "Using NEW architecture" messages

---

## 📞 Still Broken?

Provide these details:

1. **URL you're using**: (copy from browser address bar)
2. **Console errors**: (screenshot or copy-paste)
3. **Network tab**: (screenshot of failed requests in red)
4. **Output of**: `./check-setup.sh`
5. **Server log**: Last 20 lines from server terminal

This will help diagnose the exact issue.

- ✅ Canvas loads
- ✅ Toolbar visible
- ✅ Console shows "Registered 9 tools"
- ✅ Can click Circle tool
