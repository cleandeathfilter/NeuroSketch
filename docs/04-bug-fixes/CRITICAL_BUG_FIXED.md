# 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Objects Not Visible

## 🎯 The Problem

**Symptom**: Drawing shapes showed dotted preview, but when releasing mouse, nothing appeared on canvas.

**User Report**: "I can't even draw any shapes on the canvas. It draws a dotted line version of the shapes and then when you release mouse nothing appears."

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Happening:
1. ✅ Objects WERE being created (console showed "Created object: circle")
2. ✅ Objects WERE being added to `this.objects` array
3. ✅ Render loop WAS iterating through objects
4. ❌ Objects WERE NOT being drawn (invisible!)

### The Bug:

**Location**: All new tool files (CircleTool, RectangleTool, LineTool, TriangleTool, HexagonTool)

**Problem**: Tools created objects with `color: '#000000'` property

**Expected**: Renderer expects `strokeColor: '#000000'` property

**Code Mismatch**:

```javascript
// ❌ WHAT TOOLS CREATED:
const circle = {
    type: 'circle',
    color: '#000000',      // Wrong property name!
    fillColor: 'transparent',
    strokeWidth: 2
};

// ✅ WHAT RENDERER EXPECTED (canvasRenderer.js line 128):
if (obj.strokeColor) {
    ctx.strokeStyle = obj.strokeColor;
    ctx.stroke();
}
// Result: No strokeColor, so stroke() never called = invisible!
```

## ✅ The Fix

Changed all 5 new tool files to use correct property name:

### Files Modified:
1. **src/tools/CircleTool.js** - Line 46: `color` → `strokeColor`
2. **src/tools/RectangleTool.js** - Line 48: `color` → `strokeColor`
3. **src/tools/LineTool.js** - Line 47: `color` → `strokeColor`
4. **src/tools/TriangleTool.js** - Line 50: `color` → `strokeColor`
5. **src/tools/HexagonTool.js** - Line 46: `color` → `strokeColor`

### Code After Fix:
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT:
const circle = {
    type: 'circle',
    strokeColor: '#000000',  // Now matches renderer expectation!
    fillColor: 'transparent',
    strokeWidth: 2
};
```

## 📊 Console Output (After Fix)

```
✅ Created circle at (108, 133)
✅ Created rectangle at (250, 180)
✅ Created line at (100, 200)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### Why This Happened:
1. **Inconsistent naming** - Old system used `color`, new renderer expects `strokeColor`
2. **No immediate testing** - Bug only found when user tested
3. **Property name mismatch** - Easy to miss in code review

### Prevention:
1. ✅ **Use consistent property names** across all tools
2. ✅ **Test immediately** after creating each tool
3. ✅ **Reference existing objects** to see what properties they use
4. ✅ **Check renderer expectations** before creating objects

### Correct Property Names for Objects:
```javascript
{
    type: 'shape',
    strokeColor: '#000000',  // NOT 'color'
    fillColor: '#ffffff',    // For filled shapes
    strokeWidth: 2,          // Line width
    x: 0,                    // Position
    y: 0
}
```
