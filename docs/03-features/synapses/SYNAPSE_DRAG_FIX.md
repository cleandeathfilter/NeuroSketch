# ✅ Synapse Dragging - Fixed

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Issue**: Synapses could be selected but not dragged with mouse
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🐛 Problem

User reported:
> "Still can't move excitatory synapse arrow, or inhibitory or electrical synapse - I can move it under the properties tab by changing x/y axis options / changing rotation values but not with mouse select."

**Root Cause**:
The drag logic in `handleMouseMove()` expects objects to have `x, y` properties, but synapses have `sourcePoint` and `targetPoint` properties instead. The drag code had no case for synapse objects.

---

## ✅ Solution

### **1. Added Drag Offset Initialization** (app.js:456-459)

When user starts dragging, store offset from click point to object anchor:

```javascript
} else if (o.type === 'synapse') {
    // For synapses, store offset from source point
    o._dragOffsetX = world.x - o.sourcePoint.x;
    o._dragOffsetY = world.y - o.sourcePoint.y;
}
```

**Why**: Ensures smooth dragging from wherever user clicks on synapse.

### **2. Added Drag Movement Logic** (app.js:707-714)

During drag, move both source and target points:

```javascript
} else if (obj.type === 'synapse') {
    // For synapses, move both source and target points
    const dx = world.x - obj._dragOffsetX - obj.sourcePoint.x;
    const dy = world.y - obj._dragOffsetY - obj.sourcePoint.y;
    obj.sourcePoint.x += dx;
    obj.sourcePoint.y += dy;
    obj.targetPoint.x += dx;
    obj.targetPoint.y += dy;
}
```

**Why**: Moves synapse as a unit, preserving the connection shape.

## 🧪 Testing

**Test now** (refresh browser):

### **Basic Dragging**:
```
1. Create synapse (connect two circles)
2. Click SELECT tool
3. Click synapse to select
4. Drag synapse → Both endpoints should move together ✅
5. Release → Synapse stays in new position ✅
```

### **Multi-Select Dragging**:
```
1. Create 2 synapses
2. Select both (drag selection box)
3. Drag selection → Both synapses move together ✅
```

### **Full Interaction Test**:
```
✅ Create synapse
✅ Select synapse (click on it)
✅ Drag synapse (moves smoothly)
✅ Delete synapse (Delete key)
✅ Copy/paste synapse (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
✅ Multi-select synapses (selection box)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Patterns Used

### **Object Type Branching**
Synapse drag logic follows established pattern:
1. Check object type
2. Apply type-specific drag calculation
3. Update object properties

**Consistent with**:
- Lines (x1/y1, x2/y2)
- Freehand paths (points array)
- Curved paths (control points)
- Unmyelinated axons (control points)

### **Drag Offset Pattern**
1. **On drag start**: Store `_dragOffsetX/Y` (offset from click to anchor)
2. **During drag**: Calculate delta from offset
3. **On drag end**: Apply final position

**Benefits**:
- Smooth dragging from anywhere on object
- Preserves object shape
- Consistent with all other draggable objects

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### **Architectural Lesson**
When adding new object types with non-standard properties:

1. ✅ Add to `getObjectBounds()` (selection)
2. ✅ Add to `getObjectCenter()` (rotation/grouping)
3. ✅ Add to drag offset initialization (smooth dragging)
4. ✅ Add to drag movement logic (actual movement)

**Without ALL four**, object won't behave like other objects.

### **Testing Lesson**
Test **all** core interactions for new objects:
- Create ✓
- Select ✓
- Delete ✓
- **Drag** ✓ (was missing!)
- Copy/paste ✓
- Multi-select ✓

Don't assume selection = dragging!

## 🎓 Updated CLAUDE.md Pattern

Pattern 0.9 already covers this:

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Every object added to the canvas MUST support these core interactions:
> - ✅ Selectable (click to select)
> - ✅ Deletable (Delete key / Cut)
> - ✅ **Moveable (drag to move)** ← This was missing!
> - ✅ Copyable (Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V)

Synapses now meet ALL requirements in Pattern 0.9.
