# Precision Selection Features

## Overview
Two new features to handle overlapping objects and dense diagrams.

---

## 1. Tab Cycling Through Overlapping Objects

### Usage
1. Click to select any object
2. Press **Tab** to cycle through all objects at that position
3. Status shows: "2/5 objects (Tab to cycle)"

### How It Works
- Stores all objects at click position
- Tab cycles through them in z-order (top to bottom)
- Works with both normal and precise mode

### Use Case
Perfect for:
- Dense neuron diagrams with overlapping dendrites
- Multiple shapes stacked on top of each other
- Quick access to objects underneath without moving things

---

## 2. Ctrl+Click Precise Hit Detection

### Usage
- **Normal Click**: Selects object if click is anywhere in bounding box
- **Ctrl+Click**: Only selects if click hits actual stroke/edge/fill

### How It Works

#### Shapes with Fill (if fillColor != transparent)
- **Circle**: Click must be inside or on stroke
- **Rectangle**: Click must be inside or on edges
- **Polygon**: Click must be inside or on edges

#### Shapes without Fill (stroke only)
- **Circle**: Click must be within `strokeWidth + 3px` of circumference
- **Rectangle**: Click must be near edges (within `strokeWidth + 3px`)
- **Polygon**: Click must be near edges
- **Line**: Click must be within `strokeWidth + 3px` of line path
- **Freehand**: Click must be within `strokeWidth + 3px` of path

#### Visual Indicator
- Orange "ðŸŽ¯ Precise Mode (Ctrl)" appears top-left when Ctrl is held

### Use Case
Perfect for:
- Selecting small shapes near large ones
- Clicking through transparent bounding boxes
- Fine control in dense diagrams
- Educational diagrams with overlapping transparent shapes

## Implementation Details

### New Functions in app.js
1. **`getObjectAt(x, y, preciseMode)`** - Modified to support precise mode
2. **`getAllObjectsAt(x, y, preciseMode)`** - Returns array of ALL objects at position
3. **`isPreciseHit(obj, x, y)`** - Geometry-based hit testing for each shape type

### New State Variables
```javascript
lastClickWorldPos: null,           // Last click position for Tab cycling
objectsAtLastClick: [],            // All objects at last click
tabCycleIndex: 0,                  // Current position in cycle
```

### Supported Shape Types
- âœ… Circle (fill + stroke detection)
- âœ… Rectangle (fill + edge detection)
- âœ… Polygon (Triangle, Square, Pentagon, Hexagon, etc. - fill + edge)
- âœ… Line (path proximity)
- âœ… Freehand (path proximity)
- âœ… Text (always bounding box - can't hit individual letters)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Tab**: Cycle through overlapping objects
- **Ctrl+Click**: Precise hit detection (stroke/edge only)

## Example Workflows

### Dense Neuron Diagram
1. Click soma â†’ selects soma
2. Press Tab â†’ cycles to dendrite underneath
3. Press Tab â†’ cycles to axon underneath
4. Press Tab â†’ back to soma

### Overlapping Transparent Shapes
1. Hold Ctrl
2. Click directly on small circle's stroke
3. Ignores large transparent rectangle's bounding box behind it

### Fine Movement Adjustments
1. Ctrl+Click to select only the shape you want (precise)
2. Drag to move
3. Tab to select next object without moving mouse

## Benefits

âœ… **Zero Breaking Changes** - Normal click behavior unchanged
âœ… **Industry Standard** - Ctrl for precision (Figma, Illustrator, Sketch)
âœ… **Keyboard-Friendly** - Tab cycling for dense diagrams
âœ… **Visual Feedback** - Shows mode and available cycles
âœ… **Geometry-Aware** - Respects fill vs stroke-only shapes
âœ… **Rotation-Compatible** - Works with rotated objects
